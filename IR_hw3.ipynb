Based on fixed-order autoregressive moving-average modeling , this method was hypothesized to be capable of dissociating the effects that hypnotic and analgesic agents have on brain electrical activity . Raw electroencephalographic waves from a previously published study were reanalyzed . In this study , 45 American Society of Anesthesiologists status I patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups according to a specific target effect-site remifentanil concentration ( 0 , 2 , and 4 ng/ml ) . All patients received stepwise-increased targeted effect-site concentrations of propofol ( CePROP ) . At each step change in target CePROP , the Observer s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score was evaluated ., Raw electroencephalograph was continuously acquired from frontal electrodes . Electroencephalography traces were analyzed using a fixed-order autoregressive moving average model to give derived measures of Cortical State and Cortical Input . Response surfaces were visualized and modeled using Hierarchical Linear Modeling . Cortical State ( a measure of cortical responsiveness ) and Cortical Input ( a measure of the magnitude of cortical input ) were shown to respond differently to CePROP and effect-site remifentanil concentration . Cortical Input decreased significantly with increasing effect-site remifentanil concentration , whereas Cortical State remained unchanged with increasing effect-site remifentanil concentration but decreased with increasing CePROP . Because Cortical State responds principally to variations in CePROP , it is a potential measure of hypnosis , whereas the dependence of Cortical Input on effect-site remifentanil concentration suggests that it may be useful as a measure of analgesic efficacy and the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance .\",\n",

            "\t\"contents\" : \"Quantitative evaluation of cortical bone architecture as a means to assess bone strength typically is accomplished on the basis of images obtained by means of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) or computed tomography . Magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging has potential advantages for this task in that it allows imaging in arbitrary scan planes at high spatial resolution . However , several hurdles have to be overcome to make this approach practical , including resolution of issues related to nonlinear receive coil sensitivity , variations in marrow composition , and the presence of periosteal isointense tissues , which all complicate segmentation . The aim of this study is to develop MR acquisition and analysis methods optimized for the detection of cortical boundaries in such complex geometries as the femoral neck . Cortical boundary detection is achieved by radially tracing intensity profiles that intersect the periosteal and endosteal boundaries of bone . Profiles subsequently are normalized to the intensity of the marrow signal , processed with morphologic image operators , and binarized . The resulting boundaries are mapped back onto the spatial image , and erroneous boundary points are removed . From the detected cortical boundaries , cortical cross-sectional area and thickness are computed . The method was evaluated on cortical bone specimens and human volunteers on the basis of high-resolution images acquired at a 1.5-Tesla field strength . To assess whether the method is sensitive to detect the expected dependencies of cortical parameters in weight-bearing bone on overall habitus , 10 women aged 46-73 years ( mean age , 56 years ) underwent the cortical imaging protocol in the proximal femur , and results were compared with DXA bone mineral density parameters of the hip and spine . Reproducibility was approximately 2 % . Double oblique images of the femoral neck in the 10 women studied showed that cortical cross-sectional area correlated strongly with height ( r = 0.88 ; p = .0008 ) , whereas cortical diameter versus age approached significance ( r = 0.61 ; p = .06 ) . Measurements in specimens of some cortical parameters indicated resolution dependence . However , note that specimen ranking within each parameter remained constant across all resolutions studied . Data suggest the new method to be robust and applicable on standard clinical MR scanners at arbitrary anatomic locations to yield clinically meaningful quantitative results .\",\n",

The effects of glucose and breastfeeding on pain-associated neonatal cortical activity were studied in two groups ( n = 30 ) by multichannel NIRS during a heel prick . Cortical activation was identified by variations in oxygenated haemoglobin . Neonatal pain expression was assessed by a validated scale . No significant variations in cortical activity emerged using glucose solution , whereas breastfed newborns showed widespread cortical activation . Breastfed neonates showed significantly less behavioural pain expression . Glucose is associated with no significant cortical activation and may interfere with pain-associated response at the cortical level . Conversely , breastfeeding analgesia is associated with generalized cortical activation and may act by multisensory stimulation , possibly overwhelming pain perception .\",\n",

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of estrogen on cortical and trabecular bone . The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study is a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial of menopausal hormone treatment ( MHT ) in women , enrolled within 6-36 months of their final menstrual period . The study was conducted at the Mayo Clinic , Rochester , Minnesota . Subjects were treated with placebo ( n = 31 ) , or .45 mg/d conjugated equine estrogens ( n = 20 ) , or transdermal 50 g/d 17-estradiol ( n = 25 ) with pulsed micronized progesterone . Cortical and trabecular microarchitecture at the distal radius was assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography . At the distal radius , cortical volumetric bone mineral density ( vBMD ) decreased , and cortical porosity increased in the placebo group ; MHT prevented these changes . By contrast , MHT did not prevent decreases in trabecular microarchitecture at the radius . However , MHT prevented decreases in trabecular vBMD at the thoracic spine ( assessed in a subset of subjects ; n = 51 ) . These results indicate that MHT prevents deterioration in radial cortical vBMD and porosity in recently menopausal women . The maintenance of cortical bone in response to estrogen likely has important clinical implications because cortical bone morphology plays an important role in bone strength . However , effects of MHT on trabecular bone at the radius differ from those at the thoracic spine . Underlying mechanisms for these site-specific effects of MHT on cortical vs trabecular bone require further investigation .\",\n",

We hypothesized that syndesmotic screw fixation with 3.5-mm fully threaded cortical screws through either three or four cortices would have similar strength and rate of mechanical failure and that retention of screws after fracture healing would not result in adverse clinical symptoms . In a prospective , surgeon-randomized study at a Level-one trauma center , 127 patients with syndesmotic disruptions were treated surgically . Seven patients were lost to followup , leaving 120 for review . Syndesmotic disruptions were stabilized with 3.5-mm fully threaded cortical screws placed through three or four cortices . Screws were removed only if symptomatic . Outcome criteria were screw failure , loss of reduction , and need for hardware removal . Fifty-nine patients received fixation through three cortices and 61 patients received fixation through four cortices . Mean follow-up was 150 days . In the group with stabilization through three cortices , hardware failure occurred in five patients ( 8 % ) and three had a loss of reduction . In the group with stabilization through four cortices , hardware failure occurred in four patients ( 7 % ) ; all were asymptomatic and did not require screw removal . There was no loss of reduction in that group . Comparing the two groups using binary logistic analysis , there was no difference in loss of reduction ( p = 0.871 ) , screw breakage ( p = 0.689 ) , or need for hardware removal ( p = 0.731 ) . The data suggest that either three or four cortices of fixation can be used when stabilizing syndesmotic injuries of the ankle . There was a trend towards higher loss of reduction in the group with tricortical fixation when weightbearing restrictions were not followed . Retention of the syndesmotic screws , even with mechanical failure , does not pose a clinical problem . Weightbearing can be allowed at 6 to 10 weeks without routine removal of screws .\",\n",

We examined the associations of cognitive domain outcomes with cerebral volumes ( hippocampus and separate groups of posterior and frontal cortical regions of interest ) and cerebrovascular imaging features ( presence of large or small cortical/subcortical infarcts and WMH volume ) . We performed mediation pathway analyses to assess the hypothesis that hippocampal and cortical volumes mediated the associations between cerebrovascular imaging features and cognition . In unmediated analyses , WMH and infarcts were both associated with worse psychomotor speed/executive function . In mediation analyses , WMH and infarct associations on psychomotor speed/executive function were significantly attenuated , but not abolished , by the inclusion of the posterior cortical regions of interest volume in the models , and the infarcts on psychomotor speed/executive function association were attenuated , but not abolished , by inclusion of the frontal cortical regions of interest volume .
